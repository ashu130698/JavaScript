- âœ… Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison)
- âœ… Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- âœ… Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for...of`)
- âœ… Functions (Normal, Arrow, Callback, IIFE)
- âœ… Scope and Closures
- âœ… Arrays and Array Methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- âœ… Objects and Object Methods
- âœ… DOM Manipulation
- âœ… Events
- âœ… ES6+ Features (Destructuring, Spread, Rest, etc.)
